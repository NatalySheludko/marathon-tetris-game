## Tetris Game 
Tetris is a classic puzzle game in which players arrange falling blocks (tetrominoes) to form complete rows that are then cleared from the game field. The game is created using JavaScript, providing a nostalgic and engaging gaming experience.

- Frontend Development: Implementing the game's frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Game Logic Implementation: Developing the core game logic in JavaScript, handling the creation, movement, and rotation of tetrominoes, as well as row clearing.
- Version Control: Using Git for version control.
- Problem Solving and Research: Identifying and resolving technical issues, conducting research to find optimal solutions, and improve the overall quality of the game.

## Key Features:
- Adaptive design for desktop (1440px).
- Game Window: Created with a specified width and height to provide a consistent and enjoyable gaming experience.
- Constants Definition: Defined constants such as block size, grid width, grid height, and colors used in the game for better code management and readability.
- Tetris Shapes Enumeration: Enumerated various Tetris shapes, each represented by a matrix of ones and zeros, where ones indicate occupied cells.
- Colors Definition: Defined colors corresponding to each Tetris shape to enhance the visual appeal of the game.
- New Piece Generation: Implemented a function to generate a new Tetris piece with a random shape and initial position.
- Piece Drawing Function: Developed a function to display a Tetris piece on the game screen based on its shape, color, row, and column position.
- Game Logic Loop: Implemented the complete game logic loop, including handling user input, updating the game state (such as moving, rotating, and dropping pieces), checking for completed rows, and displaying the game screen.
